// ASSESSMENT 3: Coding Practical Questions with Jest

// Please read all questions thoroughly
// Pseudo coding is REQUIRED
// If you get stuck, please leave comments to help us understand your thought process

// Use test driven development to complete the following questions
// Add appropriate dependencies: $ yarn add jest

// Reminder: The test will call your function
// Run the file with the following command: $ yarn jest

// --------------------1) Create a function that takes in a number (greater than 2) and returns an array that length containing the numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.

// a) Create a test with expect statements for each of the variables provided.

const fibLength1 = 6
// Expected output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]

const fibLength2 = 10
// Expected output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]

// b) Create the function that makes the test pass.

// --------------------2) Create a function that takes in an object and returns an array of the numbers sorted from least to greatest.
// Hint: Check out this resource: Object.values() https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Object/values

// a) Create a test with expect statements for each of the variables provided.

const studyMinutesWeek1 = {
  sunday: 90,
  monday: 30,
  tuesday: 20,
  wednesday: 15,
  thursday: 30,
  friday: 15,
  saturday: 60
}
// Expected output: [15, 15, 20, 30, 30, 60, 90]

const studyMinutesWeek2 = {
  sunday: 100,
  monday: 10,
  tuesday: 45,
  wednesday: 60,
  thursday: 20,
  friday: 15,
  saturday: 65
}
// Expected output: [10, 15, 20, 45, 60, 65, 100]

// b) Create the function that makes the test pass.

// --------------------3) Create a function that takes in an array and returns an array of the accumulating sum. An empty array should return an empty array.

// a) Create a test with expect statements for each of the variables provided.

const accountTransactions1 = [100, -17, -23, -9]
// Expected output: [100, 83, 60, 51]

const accountTransactions2 = [250, -89, 100, -96]
// Expected output: [250, 161, 261, 165]

const accountTransactions3 = []
// Expected output: []

// b) Create the function that makes the test pass.
