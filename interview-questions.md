# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) makes up the bones of a webpage. JSX (javaScript Syntax Extension) is used to write HTML in a JS file, such as when using React. HTML uses "class", but in JSX, "className" is needed as "class" is already a reserved keyword in JS. 

Researched answer: JSX was created for React to allow HTML to be used directly within JS files and concurrently with JS syntax. JSX requires a parent element (live a React fragment (<> </>)), while HTML does not require parent elements (you can use a <p> without an <h1>)

2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

Your answer: Yarn stands for "Yet Another Resource Negotiator". It is a set of code that works as a package manager. It makes code more readily available for sharing by "packaging" it so it can be easily transferred from local servers to the internet and to other local servers.  

Researched answer: Yarn was created by Meta (Facebook) to better manage thier React application as a packet manager. It assists by adding a Yarn file to the existing folder and updates the package.json file as needed. 

3. What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

Your answer: An anonomus function ( ex: () => ) is a small snippet of code that works without a predefined peramiter or name to call it. 

Researched answer: Where normally we would name each function in order to be able to call it later, an anonomus function doesn't need a name because it is not called later and only works within it's existing scope. 

4. What is the difference between state values and props in React?

Your answer: A state in React is a piece of code that can be modified and updated or changed. A prop is a value that connects components via parent-child link. 

Researched answer: State is local to a class component while props are more like peramiters passed to a component via a parent-child link. 

5. What is the DOM?

Your answer: The DOM (Document Object Model) is, essentially, what is physically rendered, or shown, on a webpage. 

Researched answer: The DOM is the representation of the code (back end) to the webpage (front end). It is what we see when we visit w webpage. 

6. STRETCH: Which is the difference between a div and a span?

Your answer: While span and div are both used in HTML, div refers to a block level seperator while span refers to specific lines. 

Researched answer: Span is used to style specific elements via organization and styling while div is used over an entire block (or group) of elements. 
 
## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Object-oriented programming: OOP is a method of coding htat creates objects using both data and functions. It is based on the DRY (don't repeat yourself) motto. 

2. Ruby: Ruby is a programming language that is used to build web application such as servers and data processing. 

3. Implicit return: When functions need only one expression on a single line, the curly braces are not needed. 

4. Ruby blocks: A Ruby block is an anonomus function that can be passed inot a method. 

5. Ruby hashes: A Ruby hash is used to store data as key:value pairs without an index like an array.
