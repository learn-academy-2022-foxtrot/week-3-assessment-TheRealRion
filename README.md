# Assessment for Week 3

Being a developer requires an acute attention to detail. The expectation of this assessment is that all instructions are read carefully and followed completely.

A good developer will ask clarifying questions when a task is unclear and use all the resources at their disposal.

The step-by-step instructions [here](https://github.com/LEARNAcademy/Syllabus/blob/main/github/assessments.md) breakdown the git and GitHub process for this assessment.

Assessment should be accessed through the GitHub Classroom link provided to you in Slack.

PRs should be posted _before_ class begins on the following Monday.

### Assessment Review Process

When an instructor reviews a student's assessment the instructor is evaluating the work through the lens of the Dreyfus model of skill acquisition. The Dreyfus model describes how individuals progress through various levels in their learning process of new skills in the following levels: novice, advanced beginner, competent, proficient, expert. For this course students will be evaluated as novice, advanced beginner, or competent skill levels. Skill levels are not grades! Skill levels measure current understanding of a set of topics covered in class.

**Incomplete**  
An assessment that is considered incomplete is one that did not meet the requirements of a valid attempt on every question. Incomplete assessments will not be reviewed and will be returned to the student for completion. Students with incomplete assessments will not be able access the next assessment until the current one is complete. An assessment will be considered incomplete due to the following:

- questions with no answer (excluding STRETCH options)
- no pseudo code when requested
- non-working code with no accompanying explanation

**Complete**  
An assessment that is considered complete is one that met the bare minimum requirements of a valid attempt on every question. An assessment that is considered complete did not display enough effort to reach the novice level of skill acquisition.

**Novice**  
The novice stage is the first level of skill acquisition. In the novice level, the student is just beginning to understand the skill and requires a step-by-step "recipe" to produce an output. An assessment that is considered at the novice level of skill acquisition is one that met the requirements of a valid attempt on every question while closely following process notes from class to produce:

- basic pseudo code
- code that will output content in the terminal
- "your answers" written in the student's own words
- researched answers written in the student's own words that provides additional context

**Advanced Beginner**  
The advanced beginner stage is the second level of skill acquisition. In the advanced beginner level, the student can begin to troubleshoot problems on their own and can decide if the "recipe" will be able to produce a particular outcome. An assessment that is considered at the advanced beginner level of skill acquisition is one that met the requirements of a valid attempt on every question while adapting process notes from class to produce:

- pseudo code with proper vocabulary terms
- code that will output correct content in the terminal
- "your answers" written in complete sentences the student's own words that provide partially correct comments
- researched answers written in complete sentences in the student's own words that provides additional context

**Competent**  
The competent stage is the third level of skill acquisition. In the competent level, the student can decide what information is relevant to solve the problem and can begin to create their own "recipe" to produce a particular outcome. An assessment that is considered at the competent level of skill acquisition is one that met the requirements of a valid attempt on every question while adapting process notes from class as well as from other resources to produce:

- detailed pseudo code with proper vocabulary terms
- code that will output correct content in the terminal following best practices
- "your answers" written in complete sentences the student's own words that provide correct answers
- well researched and detailed answers written in complete sentences in the student's own words that provides additional context
